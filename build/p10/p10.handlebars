                <h1>Service Introduction</h1>
                <p><strong>The concept is quite simple.</strong></p>
                <p>I will design and build a high fidelity web prototype in 10 days. Pricing is variable. Most projects end up costing between $5k and $10k. A web prototype does not necessarily mean the subject matter of the prototype being web based. A web prototype simply means I will use web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) to build the prototype. These prototypes can be used to demo web, mobile or native apps.</p>
                <h1>Product Value</h1>
                <p>Prototypes are the new MVP. They can be used to show a new feature or an entire new product.</p>
                <h2>1. Market Validation:</h2>
                <p>Does your company have a new idea for a product? Too busy with building your bread and butter to devote engineering cycles to a prototype? Let me work with your product team to build a prototype that you can take to conferences and meetings to test the idea.</p>
                <h2>2. Building a Bridge:</h2>
                <p>Does your design team have issues with a delivered product? Does you engineering team have issues with building. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.
